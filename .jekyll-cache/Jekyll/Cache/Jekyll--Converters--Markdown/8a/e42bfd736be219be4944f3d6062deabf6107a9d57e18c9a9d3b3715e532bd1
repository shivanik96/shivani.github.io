I"°<p>A SAT solver that uses different statistical optimization algorithms to solve SAT problems encoded in the DIMACS format. This solver is written in Python and uses <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">Numpy</a> to speed up calculations. The two main algorithms in this solver are an <em>ant colony optimization algorithm</em> and a <em>genetic algorithm</em>. To support these algorithms, there are some pre-processing algorithms.</p>

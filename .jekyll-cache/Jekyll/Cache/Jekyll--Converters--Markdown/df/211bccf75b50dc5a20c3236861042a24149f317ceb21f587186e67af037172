I"¤<p>For <a href="http://www.patrickbaudisch.com/">Patrick Baudischâ€™s</a> <a href="https://hpi.de/baudisch/teaching.html">HCI class at HPI</a>, we had to implement an application that usually requires large screens on a iPod nano (enough for 4 buttons). We implemented a GIS application to geo-reference images by simply aligning points. We introduced the concept of an X-Ray layer to align points on small devices.</p>

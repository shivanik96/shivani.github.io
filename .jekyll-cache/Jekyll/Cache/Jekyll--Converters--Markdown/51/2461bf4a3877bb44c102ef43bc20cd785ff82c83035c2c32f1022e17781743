Dysregulation of a gene’s function, either due to mutations or impairments in regulatory networks, often triggers pathological states in the affected tissue. Comprehensive mapping of these apparent gene–pathology relationships is an ever-daunting task, primarily due to genetic pleiotropy and lack of suitable computational approaches. With the advent of high throughput genomics platforms and community scale initiatives such as the Human Cell Landscape project, researchers have been able to create gene expression portraits of healthy tissues resolved at the level of single cells. However, a similar wealth of knowledge is currently not at our finger-tip when it comes to diseases. This is because the genetic manifestation of a disease is often quite diverse and is confounded by several clinical and demographic covariates.</p>
